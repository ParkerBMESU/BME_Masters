# BME_Masters
All code scripts used in this project can be found in this repositry 

Files can be understood as they were chronologically used in this project 

#1 Light Detection System C Code 
Refers to the Arduino script used to operate the sensors - Algorithm 1

#2 FluoPi Imaging script
Refers to the imaging script used to take images of _V. fischeri_ bioluminescent plates - Algorithm 2

#3 Computer Vision Pipeline For BL images
Refers to the initial component of Algorithm 3, where images are enhanced, and bioluminescent spots are annotated

#4 SSIM for batches
Refers to the code used to generate SSIM curves for the comparison of annotated images that have been treated vs annotated images that have not been treated

#5 Lightness measurements
Generation of lightness boxplots that compare lightness of treated plates to the control plate

#6 Multi Class Image Classification Model 
The code used to generate 2 classification models. Namely `model_treated_10epochs.h5` and `model_extent_10epochs.h5` - Algorithm 4

Image files are too many to upload to GitHub. All images and supporting files can be found here: https://stellenbosch-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/20671350_sun_ac_za/EqKjfRko9C5GiIo24k7IzQ4BVhDBTehVGDNjwUYhFqIzbw?e=jEbRyS
